The es shell supports doing literate programming (aha,
for some defintions of "literate" and "programming").

For instance, this is implemented in the following file:

; less -e literat.es

Multiple lines are executed as a chunk:

; fn rev3 a b c {
;   echo $c $b $a
; }
; rev3 one two three

Also

; let (a = b)
;   echo $a

Nice.
